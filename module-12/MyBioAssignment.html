                        Crocheting is my favorite hobby because it allows me to be creative and busy. I can create toys, clothing, blankets, etc. and it helps with my anxiety.

                        In the last 3 years I have picked up gardening and every year our garden gets larger. I like to grow my garden from seed and get my children involed with me. Along with gardening we have added chickens in the last year.
